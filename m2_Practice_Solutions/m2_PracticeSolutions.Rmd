```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
data("iris")
attach(iris)
```

Let me look at the first few rows to get a sense of the data.
```{r}
head(iris)
```

To find the mean I'll use the command `mean`. Note since I attached the data set above, I don't need to use the `$` notation.
```{r}
mean(Petal.Width)
```

Now for standard deviation.
```{r}
sd(Petal.Width)
```

Now a scatterplot of petal length vs petal width.
```{r}
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width)
```
