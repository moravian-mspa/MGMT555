STORY BEHIND THE DATA:

The Executive Express Café was founded 2009 and is run by undergraduate business students as part of their capstone course. It reopened in a new location in 2012 that is a spacious professionally designed space. This relocation has had a positive impact on sales with daily sales increasing almost 30%. There have been new products and improvements in the student run business including an espresso machine, various featured items from local restaurants and a POS system. The café data were collected from daily sales for this student run café located in the College of Business. It is a real data set that can be used for various data analyses. The data also have practical significance as they will aid in real and instructional business decision-making. The undergraduate students that run the café will use the data analysis to help with the ordering and processing of the café product lines. Various scenarios can be shaped for statistical instructional purposes by instructors. This data set showcases daily time series data from the café operations.
