## Training Program

First I'll import the `TrainingProgram` dataset.  I'll `attach` it so its easy to refer to the columns, then I'll look at the first few rows.

```{r}
TrainingProgram <- read_csv("TrainingProgram.csv")
attach(TrainingProgram)
head(TrainingProgram)
```

### **1** find mean and sd for each
```{r}
print("means:")
tapply(Scores, Exam, mean)
print("standard deviations:")
tapply(Scores, Exam, sd)
```

### **2** Check assumptions

**Independence** The people were randomly assigned to two training programs, so the samples are independent.

**Normality** We can use boxplots to help us decide if the distributions seem approximately symmetric.
```{r}
boxplot(Scores ~ Exam)
```
Both seem reasonably symmetric with no outliers, so we can assume they are approximately normal.

**Standard Deviations** looking at the standard deviations above, they meet our criteria.


### **3** Run the test
Now run the test.
```{r}
myAnalysis <- aov(Scores ~ Exam)
summary(myAnalysis)
```

The p-value is 0.26 which is rather large, so we do not have evidence that the mean scores are different in the two groups.


## Aisle location

Import the dataset, `attach` it, look at the first few rows.

```{r}
AisleLocation <- read_csv("AisleLocation.csv")
attach(AisleLocation)
head(AisleLocation)
```

### **1** find mean and sd for each
```{r}
print("means:")
tapply(Time, Location, mean)
print("standard deviations:")
tapply(Time, Location, sd)
```

### **2** Check assumptions

**Independence** Seems a reasonable assumption since subjects were assigned randomly.

**Normality**  Let's check boxplots.
```{r}
boxplot(Time ~ Location)
```

The `Middle` category does not look at all normal.  It is not symmetric and has some outliers.  I don't think the normality assumption is met, so we cannot use the ANOVA test.

I would recommend we collect more data with more subjects if possible.


### **3** I won't run the ANOVA because the assumptions are not met.


## New Packaging
Import the dataset, `attach` it, look at the first few rows.
```{r}
Packaging <- read_csv("Packaging.csv")
attach(Packaging)
head(Packaging)
```

### **1** Mean and sd
```{r}
print("means:")
tapply(Rating, Design, mean)
print("standard deviations:")
tapply(Rating, Design, sd)
```

### **2** Check the assumptions

**Independence** Seems a reasonable assumption since subjects were assigned randomly.

**Normality**  Let's check boxplots.
```{r}
boxplot(Rating ~ Design)
```
`Old` might have a slight skew, but both are reasonably symmetric, so we are ok with the normality assumption.

**Standard Deviations** 
The standard deviations calculated above are fine.


### **3** Now run the test
```{r}
packageAnalysis <- aov(Rating ~ Design)
summary(packageAnalysis)
```

The p-value is less than 0.05, so we have some moderate evidence that there is a difference in the mean values between the two package designs.
