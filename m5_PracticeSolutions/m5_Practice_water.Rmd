## Part 1, the water data
```{r}
water <- read_csv("water.csv")
attach(water)
```

```{r}
pairs(water)
```

Of the variables, `Days` seems to have the least correlation with `Water`.

```{r}
cor(water)
```

The correlation coefficients confirm what I saw in the plots above.

Let's try to create a model.
```{r}
summary(lm(Water ~ Temperature + Production + Days + Persons))
```

As we suspected, `Days` is the least significant. We remove that variable.
```{r}
summary(lm(Water ~  Production + Persons))
```

At this point all the variables are significant so we keep them in our final model.
